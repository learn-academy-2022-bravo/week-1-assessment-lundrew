# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Github is an open source hub for files, git is the program that makes gitHub possible

  Researched answer: Github is a platform used for version control and collaboration with code. Git is a DevOps tool that is used for source code management and is used for keeping track of source code changes.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The operators used to return a Boolean value are ">" "<" "==" "===" ">=" "<="

  Researched answer: Boolean expressions, relational operators, equality operators and logical operators output a Boolean value.

  Boolean Expressions: true, false

  Relational Operators: ">", "<", ">=", "<="

  Equality Operators: "==", "==="
  Logical Operators: "&&", "||", "!true", "!false", "!=", "!(true && false)", "!(true && true)"




3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the location of an element in an array or a character in a string. The difference between an index and a value is that an index is the location, and value is what it contains.

  Researched answer: The index is the position of a specified value. The value is what is within a variable or equal to a variable.






4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is continuous similar to looping until something stops it.

  Researched answer: Iteration in Javascript is a code that repeats until a condition is met. These loops are continuously executed to perform specific tasks.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair Programming is where two programmers are switching off writing code and directing. Programmer 1 who is coding types, while Programmer 2 directs Programmer 1 on what to type, fix errors, and research the best way to go about a problem. The programmers will then switch so both are exposed to the benefits that the two roles provide.

  Researched answer: Proper pair programming techniques include having a good headset for clear communication, collaboration through slack, taking breaks, starting with something easy, switching roles regularly, and minimizing distractions.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher-order function is a function that can take a function as an argument or returns a function.

2. Jest: Jest is used to test code. You create a javascript file and use the test() function to output in the console showing the tests had passed.

3. Objects: Objects are entities that have characteristics to define it. These values can be properties and methods and have data types like strings, numbers and booleans.

4. Method: Methods are the actions that can be performed on objects. This means when we apply a method to an object, and is executed like a function within the object.

5. Classes: Classes are used to bundle up objects so there are not duplicate properties in the code. This makes for a cleaner syntax.
